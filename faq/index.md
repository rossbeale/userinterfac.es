**Who runs userinterfac.es?**

We're a team of young developers and designers from [Reading, UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading,_Berkshire).  

We've not long graduated but we have a ton of experience, meaning we bring fresh ideas to the table.  Ross and Steve work for one of the UK's brightest digital agencies, producing mobile and web apps for huge brands on a daily basis.  Piers has an obsession with design and has previously worked with an iconic British animation studio.  Together, we produce digital solutions and other products as [Airbyte](http://airbyte.co.uk).

**Is there an RSS feed?**

Yes, find it [here](/atom.xml).

**When do you post articles?**

We aim to post a significant article **every Friday**, but we'll try and post small snippets during the week too.

**Can I suggest a topic?**

**Definitely!**  We are always on the lookout for candidate apps and interfaces.  Please [contact](/contact) us.

**Can it be my own application?**

Sure! Same as above applies. Note that we will be brutally honest, and *will* provide an honest critique.

**Can I write for you?**

For sure! Please submit a pull request on [Github]({{ site.github.repo }}).  Feel free to [contact](/contact) us beforehand.

**What is this built on?**

We use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) (including [Poole](http://getpoole.com) and [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)) as it allows us to keep things simple and focus on our content.  We host on [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and use [CloudFront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) to speed up our offering.

Everything is public on [Github]({{ site.github.repo }}) if you're interested.

**I still have a question...**

No worries, feel free to [ask](/contact) one of us directly.
